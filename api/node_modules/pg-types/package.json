  "readme": "# pg-types\n\nThis is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into JavaScript types for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git)\n\n## use\n\nThis module is consumed and exported from the root `pg` object of node-postgres.  To access it, do the following:\n\n```js\nvar types = require('pg').types\n```\n\nGenerally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.\n\nLet's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:\n\n```js\nvar types = require('pg').types\ntypes.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {\n  return parseInt(val)\n})\n```\n\n__boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.\n\nJust as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:\n\n```js\nvar types = require('pg').types\nvar moment = require('moment')\nvar TIMESTAMPTZ_OID = 1184\nvar TIMESTAMP_OID = 1114\nvar parseFn = function(val) {\n   return val === null ? null : moment(val)\n}\ntypes.setTypeParser(TIMESTAMPTZ_OID, parseFn)\ntypes.setTypeParser(TIMESTAMP_OID, parseFn)\n```\n_note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_\n\nIf you're thinking \"gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!\" worry not:\n\n```bash\n$ psql -c \"select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid\"\n```\n\nIf you want to find out the OID of a specific type:\n\n```bash\n$ psql -c \"select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid\"\n```\n\n:smile:\n\n## license\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Brian M.
